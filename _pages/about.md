I am a first-year PhD student in the Computer Science department at Yale University, advised by [Prof.Smita Krishnaswamy](https://krishnaswamylab.org/). My research interests include geometric, manifold learning, and deep learning. Specifically, I am interested in studying the characteristics that make expressive and generalizable embeddings and developing efficient and principled methods to achieve such representations. 

I graduated Magna Cum Laude from Northwestern University where I worked with [Prof. Fabian Bustamante](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~fabianb/) on distributed systems. My senior year project is on [Peer-to-Peer Forward Proxy Network](https://github.com/Danqi7/p2p_proxy). Prior to Yale, I was a master student at Princeton working on spatiotemporal modeling, advised by [Prof.Olga Russakovsky](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~olgarus/). I also worked at Meta for 2 years as a machine learning engineer,  building NLP and feed ranking models for [Job Search](https://www.facebook.com/jobs/) team.
