I am a second-year master student in the Computer Science department at Princeton University, advised by [Prof.Olga Russakovsky](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~olgarus/). My research interests include visual perception, efficient video models, video understanding and self-supervised learning.

Prior to Princeton, I graduated from Northwestern University where I worked with [Prof. Fabian Bustamante](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~fabianb/) on distributed systems. My senior project is on Peer-to-Peer Forward Proxy Network. I also worked at Facebook for 2 years as a machine learning engineer,  building NLP and feed ranking models for [Job Search](https://www.facebook.com/jobs/) team.
