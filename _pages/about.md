I am a first-year PhD student in the Computer Science department at Yale University. My research interest is to build algorithms and intelligent systems that are meaningfully useful. Prior to Yale, I was a master student at Princeton working on spatiotemporal modeling, advised by [Prof.Olga Russakovsky](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~olgarus/).

Prior to Yale/Princeton, I graduated from Northwestern University where I worked with [Prof. Fabian Bustamante](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~fabianb/) on distributed systems. My senior year project is on [Peer-to-Peer Forward Proxy Network](https://github.com/Danqi7/p2p_proxy). I also worked at Facebook for 2 years as a machine learning engineer,  building NLP and feed ranking models for [Job Search](https://www.facebook.com/jobs/) team.
